<h1>Homework 10: Geoprocessing Analysis </h1>
<h2>Zachary Conley</h2>
<h2>How close are schools in Cochise County, AZ to the oil wells in the state?</h2>
<h3>For this map I used a shapefile of all the oil wells in the United States, then selected for the ones that were in Cochise County. I intersected these with the County area from a Tiger County and Equivalent Shapefile. I set a buffer to be within a 5 mile radius which includes 11 schools all within 5 miles of a nearby oil well. I have put two png map files on this page, one showing Cochise County in full, and one just on the zoomed in oil well and buffer.</h3>
